Spring break is just around the corning and I'm really looking forward to spending some quality time with Kelsey.  We been looking at some trips to Cuba but haven't really found any that we like.

If we can't find anything we've talked about just staying on the island and just do a little exploring maybe do a few days up in Tofino, maybe the spa in Parksville and get a couples massage!

But who knows! it all kinda hinges on if we can find a trip to Cuba or not.

So we shall wait and see.
